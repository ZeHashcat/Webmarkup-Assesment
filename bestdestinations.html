                <h3>Rome</h3>
                <p>
                    Once a great empire, it went in to decline shortly after the implantation of the year system we use to this very day. The city bearing this name still contains many vestiges of the once great empire though, and that makes it a must see area for history buffs. To this day it still bears S.P.Q.R or Senātus Populusque Rōmānus proudly on it’s coat of arms, reminiscent of the times the majority of Europe was under the control of an empire. Prices for tickets start as low as 105 euro.
